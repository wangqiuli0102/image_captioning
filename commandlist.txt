Training: 
To train a model using the COCO train2014 data, first setup various parameters in the file config.py and then run a command like this:
    python main.py --phase=train --load_cnn --cnn_model_file='./vgg16_no_fc.npy' [--train_cnn]    
Turn on --train_cnn if you want to jointly train the CNN and RNN parts. Otherwise, only the RNN part is trained. The checkpoints will be saved in the folder models. 


If you want to resume the training from a checkpoint, run a command like this:
    python main.py --phase=train --load --model_file='./models/xxxxxx.npy' [--train_cnn]


To monitor the progress of training, run the following command:
    tensorboard --logdir='./summary/'


Evaluation: To evaluate a trained model using the COCO val2014 data, run a command like this:
    python main.py --phase=eval --model_file='./models/100999.npy' --beam_size=3
The result will be shown in stdout. Furthermore, the generated captions will be saved in the file val/results.json.

Inference: You can use the trained model to generate captions for any JPEG images! Put such images in the folder test/images, and run a command like this:
    python main.py --phase=test --model_file='./models/100999.npy' --beam_size=3
